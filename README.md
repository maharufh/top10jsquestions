# top10jsquestions
these are important specially for interview


Here are 10 important JavaScript concepts frequently encountered in interviews and essential for a strong understanding of the language:
Closures: Explain what a closure is, how it's created, and provide an example demonstrating its utility, such as data privacy or creating function factories.
Prototypes and Prototypal Inheritance: Describe JavaScript's prototypal inheritance model, how objects inherit properties and methods, and the role of __proto__ and prototype.
Asynchronous JavaScript (Callbacks, Promises, Async/Await): Explain the need for asynchronous programming in JavaScript and differentiate between callbacks, Promises, and the more modern async/await syntax for handling asynchronous operations.
var, let, and const: Detail the differences in scope, hoisting, and re-assignment behavior between these three keywords for variable declaration.
Event Loop: Describe the JavaScript event loop, how it manages the execution of synchronous and asynchronous code, and its role in handling tasks like user interactions and network requests.
this Keyword: Explain the behavior of the this keyword in different contexts (global, function, method, constructor, arrow functions) and how its value is determined.
Higher-Order Functions: Define higher-order functions and provide examples of common ones like map, filter, and reduce, explaining their purpose and how they operate on arrays.
Event Delegation: Explain event delegation as an optimization technique for handling events on multiple elements, and how it leverages event bubbling.
Scope (Global, Function, Block): Describe the different types of scope in JavaScript and how they impact variable accessibility and lifetime.
Destructuring Assignment: Explain array and object destructuring, providing examples of how to extract values from arrays and properties from objects concisely.
